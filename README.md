#Using solidity to code some basic mathematical operations:

## the following methods are included: 

- Basic operations:
  - Summation
  - Factorial calculation (by both iterative and recursive method)
  - Checking for prime
- Getting primes below a uint x (two ways)
- Modular inverse finder
  - ran brute force
  - very gas inefficient as chatgpt tells me still working on that part
- Square root calculator
  -will try binary search method as well
-Taylor Series
  - approx value for e^x when the function takes in x and a terminating point n for the summation.
  - gave a good idea about scaling fractional values in solidity.
  - will try for sin(x) soon as well.
